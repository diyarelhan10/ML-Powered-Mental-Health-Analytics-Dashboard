# ML-Powered-Mental-Health-Analytics-Dashboard
An end-to-end data science project that analyzes the impact of social media habits on mental health and uses Machine Learning to predict user stress levels.
## 🚀 Project Overview
This project bridges the gap between **Descriptive Analytics** (Power BI) and **Predictive Modeling** (Python). It identifies key digital triggers—like screen time and negative interactions—that lead to mental health risks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI (DAX, Interactive Filtering)
* **Machine Learning:** Python (Scikit-Learn, Random Forest)
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visuals:** Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📂 Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning:** Automated pipeline to handle temporal data and categorical encoding.
2. **Behavioral Analysis:** Power BI dashboard exploring stress trends across 7 social media platforms.
3. **Risk Prediction:** A Random Forest model that predicts if a user is 'Healthy' or 'At Risk' with **99% accuracy**.

## 📊 Visual Insights
### 1. Feature Importance
Identified **Daily Screen Time** and **Sleep Hours** as the top predictors of mental stress.

### 2. Model Accuracy
The Confusion Matrix proves the model's reliability in identifying 'At Risk' users.
